# ffxiv-ida-scripts

A collection of useful scripts for aiding in reversing FFXIV.

These are only really tested on IDA 7.x and will not work for earlier versions due to the script entry point changing in IDA 7.0. The scripts may work if the entry point is changed to the older variant, however do so at your own risk.

## Script Folders

* `util` - Contains generally useful things that may not be applicable to FFXIV but are generally helpful
* `xiv` - FFXIV specific IDA scripts
